# arch-installer
A bash script to automate Arch Linux installation

Welcome to Arch Installer v1.0.<br>
This bash script will **TRY** to install Arch Linux on your computer/VM.<br/>
It works with some hard coded post system configurations like:
<ul>
<li>Language: pt_BR.UTF-8 UTF-8</li>
<li>Keymap: br-abnt2</li>
<li>Timezone: America/Sao_Paulo</li>
<li>Hwclock: UTC</li>
  </ul>
If these aren't your options, you can change them in the "configure" function inside source code (don't worry, it's easy ;)

Despite some efforts, this scritp was not designed to be user proof, so don't try to mess with it, because it will mess with your computer in return.

Although this script support and work with UEFI, I didn't have the opportunity (yet) to test in this environment.

**Disclaimer:** This script comes with absolutely NO warranty and I bear NO responsibility for any damage or data loss in your computer or in any data storage connected to it. Use at your own risk! You have been warned!
